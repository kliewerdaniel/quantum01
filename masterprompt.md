# Master Prompt for Developing a Full-Stack Quantum Encryption Application

## Use Case
This application will be a secure chat platform that leverages quantum computation to generate and manage encryption keys for end-to-end encrypted messaging. Users can send and receive messages securely, with quantum-generated keys ensuring resistance to classical and quantum cryptographic attacks. The platform will include user authentication, real-time messaging, key exchange, and a dashboard for managing conversations. This addresses the growing need for quantum-safe communication in an era where classical encryption may be vulnerable to future quantum computers.

## Prompt for Cline to Develop the Application
Develop a production-ready full-stack application for secure quantum-encrypted messaging with the following specifications:

### Application Overview
Create a secure chat platform where users can exchange encrypted messages using keys generated via quantum computation. Ensure the application is built for scalability and security against quantum attacks.

### Use Case Implementation
Implement the secure chat platform as described in the Use Case section above. Users should be able to register, login, create chat rooms, send real-time messages, and manage encryption keys seamlessly.

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Quantum Computation**: Use Qiskit (IBM) for quantum key generation and encryption algorithms. Integrate with IBM Quantum services for backend execution.
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI for UI components, Socket.IO for real-time client-side messaging.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for REST APIs and WebSocket support for real-time messaging. Use Pydantic for data validation.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for ORM. Ensure quantum keys are stored securely with encryption at rest.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for local development, Kubernetes for production deployment. Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- **Security**: Implement quantum-resistant encryption (e.g., NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards), JWT-based auth, and quantum key distribution where feasible.

### Core Features to Implement
1. **Quantum Key Generation**: Use Qiskit to create quantum random keys for encryption.
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: Encrypt messages with quantum-generated keys before transmission.
3. **Real-Time Messaging**: WebSocket-powered chat with immediate message delivery.
4. **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile management.
5. **Key Management Dashboard**: UI for users to view and regenerate encryption keys.
6. **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and authentication guards.
7. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling with load balancing.

### Development Guidelines
- Follow best practices for quantum computing integration (handle qubit errors, circuit depth optimization).
- Ensure modularity: Separate concerns into quantum logic, encryption utilities, API routes, and UI components.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Optimize for performance: Cache quantum key generations, minimize API calls.
- Include automated tests for all critical components.
- Document code inline and maintain README with setup instructions.

### Project Structure
- Organize code into directories: `/quantum` (Qiskit circuits), `/backend` (FastAPI app), `/frontend` (React app), `/database` (models and migrations), `/tests`, `/docs`.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (quantum API keys, database credentials).

### Testing and Deployment
- Achieve high test coverage (>80%) for both classical and quantum code.
- Deploy to a cloud platform with quantum hardware access.
- Monitor application health and quantum service availability.

Start development by initializing the project structure, then build each layer iteratively. Ensure quantum algorithms are validated against security standards. Complete all steps from the checklist for a production-certified release.
